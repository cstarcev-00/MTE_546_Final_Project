# MTE_546_Final_Project
This project was built on an Ubuntu vm where the library Libfreenect could be built to communicate with the Xbox Kinect V1 sensor.
The following links were used to build the Libfreenect library and python wrappers:
https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect
https://github.com/alwynmathew/libfreenect-with-python/blob/master/Install_libfree_ubuntu.sh

With Libfreenect built the project can be executed with an Xbox sensor connected to the vm.
